    <h3>New MANRS Routing Security Primers for Decision-makers</h3>
    <p>As a policymaker or executive, do you worry about your data getting stolen or intercepted? Or your website suffering an attack? Or your services being shut down? Today on the MANRS blog, we’re introducing new primers that explain why you should care about routing security and simple steps you can take to decrease routing security incidents.

        Four new MANRS Primers target four distinct groups:
        
        Policymakers
        Business executives
        IT executives
        Computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs)
        In each document, we explain what routing security is, why it matters to the group, how Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) can help, and steps you can take to secure your own network and the Internet as a whole. Perhaps you can update your procurement process to require MANRS compliance or encourage network operators in your jurisdiction to follow established routing security best practices.
        
        MANRS is an industry-led initiative, supported by the Internet Society. It sets a clear, commonly-agreed security baseline and builds a strong community behind it. About 700 organizations worldwide are MANRS participants.
        
        Routing security incidents have plagued the Internet for decades, but collaborative and collective action can help solve the problem. Together, we can build more resilient networks.
        
        Please read and share all of the MANRS Primers and implement the recommendations today.

    <h3>We Can’t Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals without the Internet</h3>
    <p>This week I had the opportunity to participate in a session of the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development—the United Nation’s central point of discussion of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This was a timely opportunity to discuss paths towards a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We need the Internet in this endeavor.

        It’s difficult to imagine living through the pandemic without the Internet. Researchers would have faced even greater challenges both in working to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and collaborating on the development of vaccines. It also had a profound impact on the lives of people who had access, giving many the option to work from home and continue their education.
        
        But the first year of the pandemic has left lessons that cannot be ignored. Nearly half of the world’s population lacks Internet access. This exacerbating digital divide is caused by various reasons that range from lack of infrastructure to lack of affordable services or the necessary digital skills to take advantage of the opportunities the Internet offers.
        
        The Internet is a critical enabler for sustainable development. It unlocks human capabilities and provides the platform upon which an emerging digital economy can thrive. As the Internet and digital technologies become more essential, it also becomes more urgent to connect the people who are being left behind. The SDGs take that into account, having called for universal and affordable access in least developed countries by 2020—a goal that we are still far from reaching. If we don’t take action now, we face the risk of the current digital divide deepening several other divides, such as economic and gender inequalities.
        
        Growing the Internet
        At the Internet Society we believe the Internet is for everyone. In our efforts to grow the Internet, we echo the people-centered approach of the Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation. We see this taking shape as communities around the world are finding innovative ways to be online and to empower themselves. Critical infrastructure such as local networks and Internet exchange points are being built locally, to support local needs.</p>
   <hr> <h3>Mathematics in Cryptography</h3>
    <p>Sometimes we are only interested in the remainder, upon dividing two numbers. Modulo Operator is specifically used in this case. In general, we can visualize it with the 12-hour clock. The general representation is given by, x mod N which is literally asking the remainder of x when it is divided by N. If two numbers say a and b have the same remainder when divided by N, then we say a≡b(mod N). i.e., a and b are concurrent. For example, 52≡24(mod 7) both 52 and 24 are having the same remainder 3 when divided by 7.</p>

    <h3>GraphQL for Bug Bounty</h3>
    <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs designed to provide a more efficient, powerful, and flexible REST alternative. It is based on declarative data sampling, that is, the client can specify exactly what data he needs from the API. Instead of multiple API endpoints (REST), GraphQL represents a single endpoint that provides the client with the requested data.In REST API we have to use separate endpoints to get different information but in GraphQL, the GraphQL server handles all the requests and returns only the requested information.</p>

    <h3>JavaScript — Behind the Scenes</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that makes web pages behave and interact, the way they are on the modern Internet today. Hands down, this language is the preferred choice for developing modern web applications and web apps. JavaScript comes with huge community support and online libraries and frameworks, which makes it so much easier to get started with web development.</p>
    <p>Were you always that curious tech enthusiast, who wanted to know what happens behind the scenes. Have you ever wondered how JavaScript executes code in the back, how functions are processed, and how the popular non-blocking concurrency model works in the runtime?</p>
    <p>The JavaScript runtime is responsible for providing the environment space for executing the code inside the browser. Looking at the runtime, we can observe a component called the JS engine that performs the actual execution of the code. It comprises the call stack, responsible for executing the JS code and object heap, an unstructured memory pool for storing objects.</p>
